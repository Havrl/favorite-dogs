# FavoriteDogs

Angular webapp that presents a gallery of 6 random dog images from https://random.dog/woof.json. 
It allows users to choose one (or  more) to favorite (saved into local storage).  
The users are able to refresh the screen to get 6 more. 
 
The styling is built with flexbox so that it arranges itself correctly for mobile screens.
